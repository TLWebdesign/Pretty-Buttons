# Pretty Buttons Module for Joomla 4

This module lets you add buttons to your website. You can add icons via the icon class field, button classes via the button class field and a text and link. 

The layout code is using bootstrap 4 & 5 compatible classes.

I've left the icon and button classes completely open so it can be adapted to as many situations as possible.

Got suggestions or other comments? Feel free to open an issue on github.
